# Metal-Organic-Frameworks

My final research at the University of Texas at Austin was done in Dr. Humphrey's lab. Working in tandem experimentally and computationally. My goal was to expand a metal organic frameworks using biphosphate dendate ligands to make pores bigger of these frameworks, working conjunctly I also set out to start a computational method in predicting molecule insertion into these frameworks. 

Unfortunately I did not snap a picture of my fume hood at the time but I do have this neat insertion picture of a molecule in a framework.

Using the Schrodinger software maestro to first build the framework from crystallography files and then virtually build the small molecule for insertion and render it's 3D minimal energy state.

Depicted below you can witness the Glide engine doing it's minimizing calculations
